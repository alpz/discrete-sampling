    "# Sampling Subsets with Gumbel-Top $k$ Relaxations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we show how to include a subset sampling component in differentiable models using Gumbel Top $k$ relaxations.\n",
    "First we show how to build a differentiable subset sampler and then we show one application to differentiable $k$ nearnest neighbor classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally speaking we are given $N$ elements with weights $w_i$.\n",
    "We would like to sample $k$ elements from $N$ without replacement.\n",
    "Stated otherwise, we want a $k$-element subset $S=\\{w_{i_1}, w_{i_2},\\ldots, w_{i_k}\\}$ from $N$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given total weight $Z=\\sum w_i$, the first element is sampled with probability $\\frac{w_{i_1}}{Z}$, the second with probability $\\frac{w_{i_2}}{Z-w_{i_1}}$ and so on for $k$ elements.\n",
    "Multiplying the factors gives the following distribution for $k$ element subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(S) = \\frac{w_{i_1}}{Z}  \\frac{w_{i_2}}{Z-w_{i_1}}\\cdots \\frac{w_{i_k}}{Z-\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} w_{i_j}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction we showed how sampling from a categorical distribution could be recast as choosing the argmax of a set of Gumbel random variables.\n",
    "Relaxing the argmax with a softmax allowed us to approximate sampling from the target categorical distribution. \n",
    "A temperature could be used to control the extent of relaxation.\n",
    "In this case the the categorical probabilities are given by the softmax distrbution\n",
    "$$p_i = \\frac{exp(x_i)}{\\sum_j exp(x_j)} = \\frac{w_i}{\\sum_j w_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that by selecting the $k$ largest Gumbel random variables instead of just the largest we can sample subsets according to the sampling without replacement probability given above.\n",
    "This procedure is closely related to a procedure known by the name of weighted reservoir sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seen this way, the Gumbel-Argmax trick is a method for sampling subsets of size $k=1$ with probabilities given by $p_i$.\n",
    "Replacing the argmax by a Top-$k$ procedure for selecting the $k$ largest elements generalizes the Gumbel-Argmax to sample size $k$ subsets with probablity $p(S)$.\n",
    "In this case we think of the Top-$k$ procedure as returning a $k$-hot vector $y$ where $y_i=1$ if the $i$th element is selected and $y_i=0$ otherwise.\n",
    "Thus we represent subsets as $k$-hot vectors which also generalizes the representation of categorical samples as 1-hot vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unrelaxed subset sampling procedure can then be written as follows given non-negative weights $w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute keys $\\hat{r_i} = -\\log(-\\log(u_i)) +  \\log(w_i)$ for all $i$ and $u_i \\in U(0,1)$.\n",
    "2. Return $k$ largest keys $\\hat{r_i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top $k$ Relaxation\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: ref\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct an unrelaxed Top $k$ by iteratively applying the softmax $k$ times and sampling a 1-hot categorical sample at each step.\n",
    "The $k$ 1-hot categorical samples are then combined into a single $k$-vector.\n",
    "When the categorical sample gives a particular element, the log probablity for that element is set to $-\\infty$ for the future iterations so that the element is never chosen again. We can relax this procedure by replacing samples from the softmax by the probabilties computed by softmax. When the softmax temperature is set to be small, the sampled and the relaxed outputs are close.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail the procedure is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unrelaxed Version\n",
    "For $i=1\\ldots n$ and $j=1\\ldots k$, set $ \\alpha^1_i = \\hat{r_i}$ and $\\alpha_i^{j+1} = \\alpha_i^{j} + \\log(1-a_i^j)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $a^j_i$ is a sample the categorical distribution with probabilities $p(a^j_i = 1) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i^{j}/\\tau)}{\\sum_k\\exp(\\alpha_k^{j}/\\tau)}$ and $\\tau$ is a temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when $a_i^j$ is a 1-hot categorical sample the $\\log(1-a_i^j)$ term in the first equation above sets the next $\\alpha_i^{j+1}$ to $-\\infty$ if $a_i^j=1$ and leaves it unchanged otherwise.\n",
    "This ensures that the $i$th element once sampled is not sampled in the next steps.\n",
    "Finally we add all the $k$ vectors as $\\sum_j a^j$ and return the output as the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relaxed Version\n",
    "To relax the above procedure we can replace the categorical sample at step by its expectation.\n",
    "In this case the update becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "For $i=1\\ldots n$ and $j=1\\ldots k$, set $ \\alpha^1_i = \\hat{r_i}$ and $\\alpha_i^{j+1} = \\alpha_i^{j} + \\log(1-p(a_i^j=1))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(a^j_i = 1) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i^{j}/\\tau)}{\\sum_k\\exp(\\alpha_k^{j}/\\tau)}$ as above.\n",
    "At low values of $\\tau$ the softmax distribution becomes close to deterministic outputs a value that is close to $k$-hot.\n",
    "The temperature variable is a hyperparameter and ideally should be annealed from larger to smaller values during the course of training.\n",
    "However, in most applications the temperature is left fixed per trial and tuned using cross validation.\n",
    "Proper tuning of temperature can have a significant effect on the performance of the model.\n"
